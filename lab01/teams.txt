CS-262

Exercise 1.2

1. Demographics:
  a. I'm a junior
  b. I'm double majoring in B.CS and BS. Accounting
  c. I got an A in CS-112, and I'm currently taking CS-212

2. Technical
  a. I haven't worked with either at all.
  b. I've used Slack for Calvin Hacks, Trello for my office assisstant job in the music department, and Git/GitHub for CalvinHacks and a mini personal project. 
  c. I want to work on a project that most people can use. For example, a movie/tv show tracker. Another thing I thought about working on is a version of SlatePermutate, but on crack: it would be able to determine if you can fit in another major, or another minor, and what courses can fit into your current four-year plan with the time you have remaining in your schedule. 

3. Personality
  a. Openness seems to be the big one; I've been given the title Empathic Idealist
  b. I'd really like to be with Zach Chin, Advait Scaria, and Hyechan Jun. 

4. Working on a project with these people would be great as we live in the same apartment together (two of those three whom I listed).
